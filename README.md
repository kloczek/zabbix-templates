## Zabbix templates

List of templates:
- ICMP
- MIB
  - F5-BIGIP-LOCAL-MIB
  - F5-BIGIP-SYSTEM-MIB
  - IF-MIB
  - IP-MIB
  - SNMP-MPD-MIB
  - SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB
  - SNMPv2-MIB
  - SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB
  - UDP-MIB
- OS Linux
- OS Solaris
- OS Windows
- SNMP Devices
  - BIG-IP 5000
  - DSL-3782
- Service Apache
- Service MySQL
- Service Zabbix Agent
- Service Zabbix Proxy
- Service Zabbix Server

Notes:
* If it is something which needs to be done to use those templates it is described in each template within description notes
* Each template in the description field has the last modification date and internal version

Templated items, applications and triggers must adhere to this naming convention using 2-4 letter abbreviations:
```
<CLASS>::<Name>
<CLASS>::<SUBCLASS>::<Name>
```
Examples:
```
HW::CPU
MEM::Total Memory
NET::ICMP::Loss
NTP::WTS::Clock Frequency Adjustment
```
This is to provide a parseable name, allowing us to distinguish between and categorise those objects.
Such convention is quite easy to handle as pattern in alarming layer allowing for example send all tigger with SYS:: in the beginning name of the template to exact team.
Such pattern is possible to use part of the general interface on communication with external services.

* Do not use {HOSTNAME} macros in triggers, as web frontend from Monitoring -> Triggers has a list with "host" column name on the host where the trigger is active (it is waste of space on web page)
